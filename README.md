% by LoRd_MuldeR &lt;<mulder2@gmx>&gt; | <http://muldersoft.com/>


Contents
========

The following tools, 32-Bit and 64-Bit versions, are included in the ‚ÄúMSleep‚Äù suite at this time:

msleep
------

Wait (sleep) for the specified amount of time, in milliseconds.

```
Usage:
   msleep.exe <timeout_ms>

Note: Process creation overhead will be measured and compensated.
```

notifywait
----------

Wait until a file is changed. File changes are detected via "archive" bit.

```
Usage:
   notifywait.exe [options] <filename_1> [<filename_2> ... <filename_N>]

Options:
   --clear  unset the "archive" bit *before* monitoring for file changes
   --reset  unset the "archive" bit *after* a file change was detected
   --quiet  do *not* print the file name that changed to standard output
   --debug  turn *on* additional diagnostic output (for testing only!)

Remarks:
   The operating system sets the "archive" bit whenever a file is changed.
   If, initially, the "archive" bit is set, program terminates right away.
   If *multiple* files are given, program terminates on *any* file change.
```

realpath
--------

Convert file name or relative path into fully qualified "canonical" path.

```
Usage:
   realpath.exe [options] <filename_1> [<filename_2> ... <filename_N>]

Options:
   --exists     requires the target file system object to exist
   --file       requires the target path to point to a regular file
   --directory  requires the target path to point to a directory
```
