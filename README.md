% by LoRd_MuldeR &lt;<mulder2@gmx>&gt; | <http://muldersoft.com/>


Contents
========

The following tools, 32-Bit and 64-Bit versions, are included in the ‚ÄúMSleep‚Äù suite at this time:

msleep
------

Wait (sleep) for the specified amount of time, in milliseconds.

```
Usage:
   msleep.exe <timeout_ms>

Exit status:
   0 - Timeout expired normally
   1 - Failed with error
   2 - Interrupted by user

Note: Process creation overhead will be measured and compensated.
```

notifywait
----------

Wait until a file is changed. File changes are detected via "archive" bit.

```
Usage:
   notifywait.exe [options] <filename_1> [<filename_2> ... <filename_N>]

Options:
   --clear  unset the "archive" bit *before* monitoring for file changes
   --reset  unset the "archive" bit *after* a file change was detected
   --quiet  do *not* print the file name that changed to standard output
   --debug  turn *on* additional diagnostic output (for testing only!)

Exit status:
   0 - File change was detected
   1 - Failed with error
   2 - Interrupted by user

Remarks:
   The operating system sets the "archive" bit whenever a file is changed.
   If, initially, the "archive" bit is set, program terminates right away.
   If *multiple* files are given, program terminates on *any* file change.
```

realpath
--------

Convert file name or relative path into fully qualified "canonical" path.

```
Usage:
   realpath.exe [options] <filename_1> [<filename_2> ... <filename_N>]

Options:
   --exists     requires the target file system object to exist
   --file       requires the target path to point to a regular file
   --directory  requires the target path to point to a directory

Exit status:
   0 - Path converted successfully
   1 - Failed with error
   2 - Interrupted by user
```

waitpid
-------

Wait (sleep) until the specified processes all have terminated.

```
Usage:
   waitpid.exe [options] <PID_1> [<PID_2> ... <PID_n>]

Options:
   --waitone   exit as soon as *any* of the specified processes terminates
   --shutdown  power off the machine, as soon as the processes have terminated
   --timeout   exit as soon as the timeout (default: 30 sec) has expired
   --pedantic  abort with error, if a specified process can *not* be opened
   --quiet     do *not* print any diagnostic messages; errors are shown anyway

Environment:
   WAITPID_TIMEOUT  timeout in millisonds, only if `--timeout` is specified

Exit status:
   0 - Processes have terminated normally
   1 - Failed with error
   2 - Aborted because the timeout has expired
   3 - Interrupted by user
   
```
